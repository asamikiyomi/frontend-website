composer install --no-dev
```

#### 3. Set up configuration

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    root /var/www/phoenixpanel/public;
    index index.php;

    # SSL Configuration (recommended)
    # listen 443 ssl http2;
    # ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem;
    # ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
